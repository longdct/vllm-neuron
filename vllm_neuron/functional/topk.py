# ``topk()`` dispatcher inside the graph (it is a host dispatcher, not a
# torch-traceable ``@nki.jit`` kernel, and vllm-neuron also layers its own
# distributed orchestration on top). Instead we mirror nkilib's method dispatch
# at this layer: ``_select_topk_method`` picks a ``SupportedTopkMethods`` value,
# and ``_topk_nki`` HOP-wraps the matching ``@nki.jit`` kernel, reusing nkilib's
# own ``SupportedTopkMethods`` enum and config factories so the two never drift.
#
# Today only ROTATIONAL is selectable. The GpSIMD ``nisa.topk`` path will be
# added to this SAME seam (``_select_topk_method`` + ``_TOPK_KERNELS``) once its
# ISA is available in a consumable image; until then it is intentionally absent.

    Args:
        tensor: Input tensor.
        k: Number of top elements to select.
        dim: Dimension along which to find topk.

    Returns:
        Tuple of (values, indices) with top-k elements.
