"""MoE-combine reduce-scatter, fused as intra-device all-to-all-v + on-chip sum.

`reduce_scatter_v` provides the variable-length sum-reduce + scatter used by the MoE
EP/TP decode combine (the intra-TP reduce-scatter of partial expert-MLP outputs). It is
built on `nki.collectives.all_to_all_v` rather than a dedicated `reduce_scatter_v` NIR op
(not exposed in any reachable NKI wheel):

    1. A2A-v scatter: each source rank `r` sends rank `d` the rows destined for `d`'s
       output partition. Rows are variable-length (real per-(src,dst) token counts) and
       front-packed within a fixed `recv_rows`-tall slot. After the collective, rank `d`
       holds `world_size` slots (one per source), each carrying the SAME tokens in the
       SAME order for `d`.
    2. On-chip sum: the `world_size` slots are reduced element-wise (positional sum) into
       rank `d`'s reduced partition `[recv_rows, H]`.

Both steps run inside a single `@nki.jit` kernel / NEFF: the collective writes a
`shared_hbm` intermediate; the reduction DMAs the per-source slots into SBUF and
accumulates there (LNC-sharded on H, tiled by pmax on rows). There is no torch-level
`[world*N, H]` intermediate and no separate reduction graph.

Reduce semantics require identical output partitioning on all ranks, so every rank passes
the same `recv_row_counts`; with `T` total rows and `TP = world_size` the per-rank slot
is `recv_rows = T // TP` (T must be divisible by TP). The input carries 2 trailing
packed-token-index columns ([N, H+2]) that are not reduced (see `cc_use_intermediate_io`).

The intra-device A2A-v path requires the intra-chip runtime (libnrt 2.x.60026.0,
CR-284747640); the NKI API is unchanged.

    Reduces this rank's ``TP`` per-destination slots of partial expert outputs and scatters
    the reduced partition to each rank. ``T = input.shape[0]`` total rows split evenly into
    ``TP = world_size`` slots of ``recv_rows = T // TP`` rows each (``T`` must be divisible
    by ``TP``); slot ``d`` is this rank's contribution to rank ``d``'s partition, with the
    real per-(src,dst) rows front-packed and the rest zero padding.

    Args:
        input: This rank's contribution, shape ``[T, H+2]``. The last 2 columns are the
            packed token index (bitcast int32) and are NOT reduced. ``T`` is split into
            ``world_size`` contiguous slots of ``T // world_size`` rows.
        group: GroupCoordinator for the ranks the collective executes across (the intra-
            device TP group, e.g. 4 ranks on one Trn2 device).
        send_row_counts: ``send_row_counts[d]`` = real rows this rank sends to dest ``d``
            (rows, not elements). Real rows are front-packed within each fixed
            ``recv_rows`` slot; must be identical on every rank (reduce semantics).
        recv_row_counts_from: ``recv_row_counts_from[s]`` = real rows this rank receives
            from source ``s`` (``recv_counts_known=True``). For this rank's reduction all
            sources carry the SAME tokens in the SAME order, so the reduce is a positional
            sum over the ``world_size`` slots — hence all entries are equal (this rank's
            shared real received count).
        op: Reduction operator. Only ``"add"`` (sum) is supported.
        cc_use_intermediate_io: **Correctness-critical, not just perf.** Selects whether
            the kernel copies ``input`` into an internal ``shared_hbm`` buffer before the
            collective:
              - ``True``: copy first (strips the 2 id cols into an intermediate). Required
                when ``input`` is a NEFF I/O tensor — the compiler forbids a collective
                reading an I/O tensor ("cannot read IO tensors", NCC_INLA001). Use this
                for standalone/test call sites where ``input`` is a graph input.
              - ``False`` (default): feed ``input`` directly as the collective source (no
                strip; the 2 id cols ride along in transport and are not reduced). Valid
                ONLY when ``input`` is a graph intermediate (e.g. the expert-MLP output in
                the model). Faster (saves the strip copy). Passing ``False`` on a NEFF I/O
                input is a compile error, not a silent fallback.

    Returns:
        The reduced partition for this rank, shape ``[recv_rows, H]`` (no id columns).
        Only rows ``[0:real_received_count]`` are valid; the tail ``[real:recv_rows]`` is
        **undefined** (not zeroed) — callers must treat it as padding.

    Example:
        >>> # TP=4, T rows -> recv_rows = T // 4; real per-dest counts e.g. [20,10,0,34].
        >>> out = reduce_scatter_v(x, group=tp_group,

             over the fixed static_rows is exact for any runtime X (0-count rank -> all
             zeros -> output stays 0). No per-row skip needed.
