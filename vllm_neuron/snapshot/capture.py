"""Drive input-snapshot capture from the lite execution hook.

One :class:`SnapshotCapturer` is shared by every executable in the process; the
lite backend passes ``ExecuteMetadata`` on each forward so the capturer can tell
which NEFF it is running for. Bundles are written to the snapshot dir keyed by
the graph's compilation id, ``output_dir/<neff_id>/rank<N>/call<M>``. The
per-rank subdir keeps workers sharing a compilation from colliding.
